This is the code used to make the telephone work for my Capstone project: Memory Management

To view the full documentation of the project, visit my portfolio: https://gabrielbutler03.wixsite.com/gabe-butler-projects/capstone

This code is used to call an iPhone, which is synced to a MacBook. The MacBook then connects to a rotary phone using a Cell2Jack apater (https://www.cell2jack.com). This makes the rotary phone act like a Bluetooth speaker to the computer.

When someone picks up the rotary phone, they will hear a recording.

The Twilio API is utilized to make automatic phone calls that play recordings.
